9237     2   101 ago, our fathers brought     
9237     3   101 forth upon this continent    
9237     4   101 a new                        
9237     5   101 nation: conceived            
9237     6   101 in liberty, and dedicated    
9237     7   101 to the proposition that all  
9237     8   101 men are                      
9237     9   101 created equal.

9237    11   101 Now we are engaged           
9237    12   101 in a great                   
9237    13   101 civil war. .

9237    17   101 any

9237    22   101 are met on                   
9237    23   101 a                            
9237    24   101 great battlefield of that    
9237    25   101 war.                         
9237    26   101                              
9237    27   101 We have come to dedicate     
9237    28   101 a portion of that field      
9237    29   101 as a                         
9237    30   101 final resting place          
9237    31   101 for                          
9237    32   101 those who here               
9237    33   101 gave their lives that        
9237    34   101 that nation might live.      
9237    35   101 It is altogether             
9237    36   101 fitting                      
9237    37   101 and proper                   
9237    38   101 that we should do            
9237    39   101 this.                        
9237    40   101                              
9237    41   101 But, in a larger sense,      
9237    42   101 we cannot dedicate.          
9237    43   101 . .we cannot                 
9237    44   101 consecrate. . . we           
9237    45   101 cannot                       
9237    46   101 hallow                       
9237    47   101 this ground. The brave       
9237    48   101 men, living                  
9237    49   101 and dead,                    
9237    50   101 who struggled here           
9237    51   101 have consecrated             
9237    52   101 it, far above                
9237    53   101 our poor power to            
9237    54   101 add or detract. The          
9237    55   101 world will                   
9237    56   101 little note, nor             
9237    57   101 long remember, what we       
9237    58   101 say here, but                
9237    59   101 it can never                 
9237    60   101 forget what they             
9237    61   101 did here.                    
9237    62   101                              
9237    63   101 It is for us                 
9237    64   101 the living,                  
9237    65   101 rather, to be                
9237    66   101 dedicated here to            
9237    67   101 the                          
9237    68   101 unfinished work which        
9237    69   101 they who fought              
9237    70   101 here have thus far           
9237    71   101 so nobly advanced. It        
9237    72   101 is rather                    
9237    73   101 for us to be here            
9237    74   101 dedicated to the             
9237    75   101 great task remaining before  
9237    76   101 us. . .that                  
9237    77   101 from these honored dead      
9237    78   101 we take increased            
9237    79   101 devotion to that cause       
9237    80   101 for which they               
9237    81   101 gave the                     
9237    82   101 last full measure            
9237    83   101 of devotion. .               
9237    84   101 . that we here               
9237    85   101 highly resolve that these    
9237    86   101 dead shall not               
9237    87   101 have died                    
9237    88   101 in                           
9237    89   101 vain. . . that               
9237    90   101 this nation, under           
9237    91   101 God, shall have a            
9237    92   101 new birth of freedom. . .    
9237    93   101 and that                     
9237    94   101 government of                
9237    95   101 the people. . .by            
9237    96   101 the people. . .for           
9237    97   101 the people. .                
9237    98   101 . shall                      
9237    99   101 not perish                   
9237   100   101 from the earth.
